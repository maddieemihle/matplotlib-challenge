# **Matplotlib-Challenge**

## Background 
In this assignment, a hypothetical pharmaceutical company, _Pymaceuticals, Inc._, was created that specializes in cancer medications and treatments. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)—a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. I was given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice were identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, the tumor development was observed and measured in order to determine and compare the performance of _Pymaceuticals’_ drug of interest (Capomulin) against the other treatment regimens. 

My goal was to generate tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and efficiently create a summary of the results as follows using skills learned in Pandas, Python, and Matplotlib. 

All data for this dataset was generated by _edX Boot Camp LLC_, and is intended for educational purposes only. No animals were harmed in this hypothetical study. 


## Summary of Analysis 

Firstly, I prepared the data by merging the DataFrames into a single DataFrame. Then, I generated summary statistics of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume. Next, I created two bar charts and two pie charts using the Pandas method on one and the Matplotlib method on the other. Then, I calculated the final tumor volume across the four most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Then, the quartiles and IQR were calculated, and that information was used to determine if there were any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens. Using Matplotlib, I generated a box plot that shows the distribution of the final tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group. Outliers were highlighted in red. Next, I selected a single mouse that was treated with Capomulin and a line plot of tumor volume vs time point for that specific mouse. The same thing was done with a scatter plot to assess mouse weight vs the average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. Lastly, I calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen. That was plotted with the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot

## Results and Conclusions 

The analysis of the final tumor volumes across the four treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) shows that: 

* Capomulin and Ramicane: these treatments have the lowest mean tumor volumes, which indicates that they are the most effective in reducing tumor size.
* Infubinol and Ceftamin: these treatments have a higher mean tumor volume, indicating they are less effective compared to Capomulin and Ramicane.

The box plot visualization supports these findings by showing the distribution of tumor volumes for each treatment group. Capomulin and Ramicane have lower and more consistent tumor volumes, while Infubinol and Ceftamin show higher variability and larger tumor volumes. It is shown that Capomulin is also the most popular drug regimen among the mice tested within the data presented. However, Ramicane was the most successful drug treatment overall in reducing the tumor size within the mice. This data can be visualized within the box-plot. 

Based on the correlation and regression analysis, we can determine if there is a significant relationship between tumor volume and the weight of the mice treated with Capomulin. This can overall help in understanding how the weight of the mice might influence the effectiveness of the treatment. The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is 0.84, which is a positive correlation coefficient. This indicates that as the weight of the mice increases, the tumor volume also tends to increase. The slope of the linear regression line indicates the rate of change of the tumor volume with respect to the weight of the mice.


## Software Used: 

Coding was performed via Visual Studio Code using a Jupyter environment, with the dependencies Pandas and Scipy.stats, NumPy, and Matplotlib.pyplot
